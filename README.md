# FreeImages
## Description
FreeImages is a simple web application that lets users browse and search images. It was created using the Unsplash API. This application provides a user-friendly interface for searching images; the images being displayed in a grid format. It also offers a convenient "Scroll to Top" and "show more" feature.

## How It Works
- Users can enter their search query and get relevant images back in grid form.
- A "show-more" button is available for users to get additional search results.
- As users navigate down the page, a scroll button that moves the page back to the top when clicked appears.
